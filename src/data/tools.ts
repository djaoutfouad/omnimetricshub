      whatIsIt: 'Payment gateways charge a blended transaction fee consisting of a percentage of the total transaction value plus a fixed assessment fee per charge (such as standard US domestic rates of 2.9% + $0.30 on Stripe or 3.49% + $0.49 on PayPal). When invoicing clients or setting digital product prices, calculating the exact processor deduction prevents unexpected margin erosion.',
      howItWorks: 'The calculator operates in two modes: Forward mode subtracts the payment processor fee schedule from a customer invoice to show your net settled payout. Reverse mode (gross-up) solves the algebra in reverse to calculate the larger invoice total you must charge so that the remaining amount after processor deductions matches your exact desired take-home dollar figure.',
      formulaExplanation: 'In forward calculations, the processing fee equals the transaction amount multiplied by the percentage rate plus the fixed fee. In reverse gross-up calculations, the fixed fee is added to your net target and divided by (1 minus the decimal percentage rate).',
      formulaMath: `Forward Calculation (Net Payout):
• Processing Fee = (Invoice Amount × Rate%) + Fixed Fee
• Net Settled Payout = Invoice Amount - Processing Fee

Reverse Calculation (Gross-Up Target):

Where:
• Invoice Amount: Total charged to the customer card
• Desired Net Payout: Exact cash balance you wish to retain

2. Sum the numerator: $1,000.00 + $0.30 = $1,000.30.
3. Compute the denominator: 1 - 0.029 = 0.971.
4. Divide: $1,000.30 / 0.971 = $1,030.18.

Verification:
• Customer pays: $1,030.18
• Stripe fee: ($1,030.18 × 0.029) + $0.30 = $29.88 + $0.30 = $30.18

      formulaExplanation: 'Gross profit is selling price minus product cost. Margin divides gross profit by selling price and multiplies by 100. Markup divides gross profit by product cost and multiplies by 100. To find the required price for a target margin, cost is divided by (1 minus the margin percentage as a decimal).',

Target Margin Application:

1. Customs Duty = $15.00 × 0.06 = $0.90 per unit.
